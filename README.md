# Content Engagement Service

Welcome to the **Content Engagement Service**! This platform allows users to interact with content in various ways, including commenting, reacting (like, love, fire), replying to comments, reporting content or comments, and sharing content to external platforms. Additionally, content views are counted per user, ensuring accurate engagement metrics.

This service uses **Kafka** to communicate efficiently across microservices, ensuring smooth operation and scalability.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌟 Content Reactions
- **What it does**: Allows users to react to content with **like**, **love**, or **fire** reactions.
- **Why it matters**: Increases user interaction and engagement with content, providing instant feedback on the content.

### 💬 Commenting & Replies
- **What it does**: Users can comment on content and reply to existing comments.
- **Why it matters**: Facilitates discussions around content, fostering community engagement and feedback.

### 🚨 Reporting Content & Comments

- **Why it matters**: Helps maintain the quality of content and user interactions, ensuring a safe environment for users.

### 🔗 Sharing to External Platforms
- **What it does**: Users can share content to social platforms such as **Facebook**, **LinkedIn**, and **X** (formerly Twitter).
- **Why it matters**: Expands content reach by allowing users to share interesting content across their networks.

### 👀 User-based Content Views
- **What it does**: Tracks content views, counting each view per user to provide accurate engagement metrics.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures that content creators have reliable viewership data based on unique user interactions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**: For building a robust and scalable backend.
- **Kafka**: For communication between microservices, ensuring event-driven architecture.
- **Java**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Elasticsearch**: For storing and querying engagement-related data.
- **Social Media APIs**: For sharing content to platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and X.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/content-engagement.git
   cd content-engagement

2. **Set up kafka**
   - install and start kafka
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Configure the applicatoin**

4. **API Endpoint**
   - Access the API
   - Base URL: http://localhost:8080
  






## 🛡️ Security
Implement Spring Security to protect sensitive endpoints if needed.
OAuth 2.0 for authentication with third-party platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, X) when sharing content.
Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse of reporting and sharing features.
## 🧑‍💻 Kafka Integration
This service communicates via Kafka for all internal messages, such as tracking user reactions, comments, and shares across microservices.
Kafka ensures that different microservices (e.g., user service, content service, reporting service) can work independently while sharing real-time data.
